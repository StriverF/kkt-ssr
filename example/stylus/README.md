Basic Example
---

React uses the server side rendering of the [Scss](https://github.com/sass/node-sass) based application.

[`React`](https://github.com/facebook/react) + [Scss](https://github.com/sass/node-sass) + [`Express`](https://expressjs.com/)

**development**

Runs the project in development mode.  

```bash
npm run start
```

**production**

Builds the app for production to the build folder.

```bash
npm run build
```

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.
Your app is ready to be deployed!

Runs the compiled app in production.

```bash
npm run server
```
