Basic Example
---

React uses the server side rendering of the [Less](https://github.com/less/less.js) based application.

[`React`](https://github.com/facebook/react) + [`Express`](https://expressjs.com/) + [Less](https://github.com/less/less.js)

### development

Runs the project in development mode.  

```bash
npm run start
```

### production

Builds the app for production to the build folder.

```bash
npm run build
```

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.
Your app is ready to be deployed!

Runs the compiled app in production.

```bash
npm run server
```
